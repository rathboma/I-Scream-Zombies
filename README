Santa isn't real. Zombies are.





Workflow for a game:

while not players turn:
	display 'waiting for other player', or 'waiting for another player to join'

when players turn (move)
	-> show tiles the player can move to (highlight)
	-> click a tile, player moves to that tile (should be obvious the player has moved.)

when player's turn (action)
	-> sidebar should show zombies and customers with their favorite flavor + number they will buy
		- for sale, user clicks a customer, then a sub-screen pops up and asks for what to sell (select items from a list)
		- for kill, it just reduces the number of zombies
	
	-> for buy
		- user can buy quantityxflavor multiple times
		(need a finish_purchase method)
		

java workflow

	on move / action -> the player & the player's tile are returned. These can be merged into the game_state.
